- 👋 Hi! My Knowledge Lab colleagues, friends and fellow geeks call me Willie.
- 👀 I’m interested in virtualization, automation, APIs, and basic/quirky programming.
- 🌱 `I’m currently learning a lot about GitOps, app/system security, complex infrastructures. 
- 💞️ `I’m collaborating with colleagues and clients on highly secure integration/deployment pipelines, and putting on the cloud things that have never been there before.` 
- 📫 `You can reach me on LinkedIn (Guglielmo Chelazzi Grandinetti).`
